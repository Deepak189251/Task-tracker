# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- First clone this project to the local.
- Then install the dependencies and run the command for development server npm run dev

- You will land on the home page then create some tasks, perform Edit and Delete operations on them.

- You can filter tasks through title, priority and creation and end date of the task.

- You can sort also by priority and start date.
